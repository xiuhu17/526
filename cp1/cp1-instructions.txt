1. Build LLVM (8.0.1) and Clang in a separate directory 
2. Build the SROA pass using CMake; good tutorial of building LLVM passes out-of-source can be found here:
https://www.cs.cornell.edu/~asampson/blog/llvm.html
3. Make sure that you change instances with `netid` to your netid (e.g. change scalarrepl-netid to scalarrepl-<your id>).
These changes may need to be done in Makefiles as well as in source files.
4. Implement SROA pass according to the guidelines in the handout.
5. Run tests
6. Please test for functionality, interaction with different pass pipelines and include your own tests with the submission according to the
format suggested in the handout.
